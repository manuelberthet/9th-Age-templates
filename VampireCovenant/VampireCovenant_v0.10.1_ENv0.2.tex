\startarmyspecialrules

\armyspecialruleentry{\masterofundeath}

\newrule{Only models with this special rule can be chosen as General. The General is automatically designated as Master and must exchange one spell for \necromancysignaturespell{}, regardless of which Path it uses.}

\newrule{At the start of any of your player turns in which the army does not have a living Master you must nominate a character with this special rule and knowledge of at least one spell from the Path of \necromancy{}. If that character passes a Leadership test it immediately becomes the new Master.}

\armyspecialruleentry{\ashestoashes}

\newrule{At the end of the phase in which the General is killed, and each time a Leadership test is failed for gaining a new Master (or if there is no eligible character to take the test), all units with the majority of the models having this special rule must take a Leadership Test. If failed the unit suffers 1 wound for each point by which the test was failed with. These wounds are distributed following the rules for \unstable{} but can never be assigned to models without this special rule.}

\armyspecialruleentry{\newrule{\chillingshriek{X, Y}}}

Part of a model with this special rule may perform a shooting \newrule{special} attack with \range{8}. It can be used after marching and hits automatically. The target suffers X hits with strength equal to Y plus the current number of Wounds of the shooting part of model, where X and Y are the number within the brackets. When rolling to wound, compare the Strength with the target's Leadership instead of Toughness. Wounds caused are \armourpiercing{6} and \magicalattacks{}. In the combat phase the model may replace its normal attacks to instead scream at one unit that it is in base contact with it.

\armyspecialruleentry{\awaken{X}}

Models with this special rule can \raisewounds{} of all the units stated within the brackets above their starting size, using any effect with \raisewounds{}. A unit's starting size is the size they are written as in the army list. Units can be increased even beyond the maximum size written in their unit entry using this rule.

\armyspecialruleentry{\invocation{X}}

Models with this special rule can heal wounds back with \necromancysignaturespell{} equal to the amount stated in brackets. A unit cannot be increased above its starting size unless affected by a caster with the \awaken{} special rule.

\armyspecialruleentry{\reaper}

\newrule{Units consisting solely of models with this special rule may move through \removedrule{enemy} units during the Remaining Moves Sub-Phase. All Models in such units can make a single close combat attack against a single unengaged enemy unit which has been moved through. These attacks hit automatically and are distributed towards the unit as a whole.}

\armyspecialruleentry{\vampiric{X}}

Models with this special rule can make march moves as normal even when outside the range of the General's \inspiringpresence{}. They still have to test Leadership if they are within \distance{8} of enemy units. 

\newrule{At the end of the close combat phase, units with this special rule can make a single \vampiric{} roll if a model part with this special rule caused at least one wound during the phase. Roll a D6 for each \vampiric{} roll. On the roll of X+ a single wound is Raised to the unit, where X is the number stated within the brackets (a \result{1} is always a failure). Characters must cause wounds and roll for Raised wounds separately from any unit they are joined to.}

\armyspecialruleentry{\wakethedead}

Each time after an Augment spell from Path of \necromancy{} (including the \necromancyattribute{}) is resolved against a unit containing at least one model with this rule, you may select a single unit within \distance{6} of it. Until the end of the following player turn, all models in the chosen units have the \lightningreflexes{} special rule.

\armyspecialruleentry{\necromanticaura}

\newrule{Units with this special rule and friendly units within range reduce the number of wounds caused by the \ashestoashes{} and \unstable{} special rules by 1. Units with this special rule has a range equal to \distance{6}. The Battle Standard Bearer automatically has this special rule but with the range of its \holdyourground{} instead.}
